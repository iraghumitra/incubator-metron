# Introduction

This is just a sample 3rd party stellar function (which is used in our
unit testing).  If Stellar changes its API (e.g. the annotation changes
classes), then this will need to be built and the output jar of this (in
`target`) will need to be placed in `../stellar-common/src/test/classpath-resources/`.
